1.0
	* Added support for L2 penalization(alpha=0);
	* hqreg: changed argument "loss" to "method" and an option "squared" to "ls".

1.1
	* loss.hqreg.R: corrected a mistake in function "qloss".

1.2
	* cv.hqreg: added two new arguments, "fold.id" for predefined cross-validation 
	  folds, and "type.measure" for inclusion of general error measures "mse" and 
	  "mae".
	* loss.hqreg: modified definition depending on "type.measure".

1.3
  	* cv.hqreg: enabled parallel computing for cross-validation with a new argument "ncores"
  	* hqreg: set the default value of "gamma" for Huber loss to be IQR(y)/10
  	* plot.hqreg, plot.cv.hqreg: changed argument "log.x" to "log.l"
  	* removed computational redundancy and reduced memory allocation in source code
	* corrected typos in documentation

1.3-2
  	* new function "hqreg_raw" for fitting models on raw data without preprocessing
	* hqreg_raw: include an argument "intercept" that allows a "no-intercept" fit by setting intercept = FALSE
	* hqreg: no longer support preprocess = "none" since the package now has a specific function hqreg_raw for that situation
	* modify plot, predict function accordingly for the situation without an intercept
